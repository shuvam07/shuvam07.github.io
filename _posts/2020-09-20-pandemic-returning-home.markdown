Heads up -- Not a motivating story. 
The covid time is really a challenging time for most of us in different ways. While the daily workers are really trying to make the ends meet, some have managed to bring out their lost passion which were unless hard to manage with the 9-7 cycle. While I have the privilege enough to work from home also this is probably the first time I am back to my hometown where I will have the opportunity to work more closely with nature(semi-urban regions are my kind), and to explore more of my heritage district, [Murshidabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murshidabad). So I kept my weekends reserve for the exploration and the weekdays with office works and doing something productive at the same time.

I have planned to write a series of blogs related to my time during the pandemic, the good and bad experiences. 

So will start with the evil experience, since want to end the blog series on a good note. :p
