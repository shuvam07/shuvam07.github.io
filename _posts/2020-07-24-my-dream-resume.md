Creating a perfect Resume is indeed a challenging task and also a vital part of any hring process. The chances of you getting an opportunity to write a test or give an interview solely depends on this first impression which is shown through your CV(Resume). This post is to guide you to start creating <b>CV's / Journals /Publication Papers</b> using [LateX](https://www.latex-project.org/about/).

<h3><b>Usign Overleaf to CreateÂ Resume</b></h3>

<i>Step 1.</i> Create an account in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project).

<i>Step 2. </i> Either start creating from scratch (Time taking but better) <b><i>OR</i></b> <br>     use Templates that are available (Easy to goâ€Š--- recommended ðŸ˜›, Templates are mentioned in the below section) 

<i>Step 3. </i> In overleaf go to <i>New Project -> Select CV/Resume from Drop Down -> Select appropriate template -> Open as Template and start editing.</i>

Select the left pane to edit any info(Like Search for a particular string shown in the right pane and replace it ). And automatically the changes will be reflected in the right pane.

And bang, you will have a <b>nicely formatted and presentable CV.</b>

<h3><b>Things to keep inÂ Mind</b></h3>

Spend some time while creating a CV for the first time using <b>Latex</b>. Since once you are done you can just use and edit it your whole life (well most of your life).

1. Dont <b>fake</b> aything in your CV.

2. Try to confine the contents in <b>one page (Don't exaggerate anything)</b>. If you can't fit the contents in one page using this format you can try breaking the page in two columns with the right column containing less useful info that way u can save space but make sure it doesn't get clustered. One such template is shown below. (Just for format reference, ignore the contents)

	  <figcaption>CV with Two Column <b>(This is just for format reference)</b></figcaption>

3. I personally use this template [CV_Zip](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-ZHBv61hYdhgqIVtpbzjkTpBhKlUyeXQ) (You can download this and upload on overleaf to start editing, easy-peasy ðŸ˜Ž)

	[Link 2](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/plasmati-graduate-cv)<br>

	If you don't like the CV templates that are available at overleaf you can also try finding them over the internet, google search for "CV templates for Latex" or you can also find for the resume in LinkedIn of some person working in the Tier 1 companies. (Though I think Overleaf has enough templates)

4. Don't mention anything that you don't know about even if the CV is half page <b>don't elongate</b> it unnecessarily.

5. <b>No need</b> to include "career objective" / "personal details (Family, dob) "

6. Don't need to provide a wide description of your projects in the CV's. Include only info so that the interviewer gets interested and then ask you to explain what you have done.

7. Relevant languages(for programming) and <b>frameworks<b> used for a particular project should be cleary mentioned. Try to include <b>CI/CD(Continuous Integration/ Continuous Deplyoment)</b> or tools used for these as much as you can in your projects. Since it creates a good impression about the deployment technologies you have knowledge upon.

8. Try to follow the [STAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result) format for a project description if you can which will help interviewers to gather all infomation about the project.

9. You can also keep multiple CV's(usually two) handy depending on the type of Job you are applying for so that you get more space to keep your related projects and remove the non-relevant ones. (Cases in which say you are open to apply for Data Scientist role as well as Software Developer Role)

10. Include only proper and relevant work skills by that I mean don't include MS Office as your skill, since those are very lame and the basic of which is a must to have and not something which will help you stand out of the crowd.

11. Colourful text and creative fonts are not something which an interviewer will admire rather it will decrease the readability for that person and might have a negative impact so keep it as simple as possible.

12. Don't include irrelevant achievements like School Sports Captain or something(better remove the part if you don't have any), Community service or Professional achievements are notable though.

13. If you want to include hobbies, make sure they are related enough to your professional career, not something like "watching movies", "listening songs" etc.
