So Four months(starting from april during covid lockdown) I went to a nearby field regularly ( might have missed 5-6 days at max ). Why? I like sports and also suffering from Hypothyroidism which leaves me with no choice. 

My index before:

Weight -- 70kgs
Height -- 5'6"
High BMI undoubtedly

How my routine looked like (diet and exercises) --- 

Woke up at 5:00

Thyroid pill ( Thyrox 25 )

Field by 5:30

Running 3-4 kms
High knees, jumping jacks, butt kicks( 3 sets 20)
Squats, lunges ( 3 sets 15 )
Stretching
Pull up ( still trying :p )
Push ups ( 3 sets 15 )
Leg rise ( 3 sets 20 )
Plank ( 3 sets 1 minute )
Then football 10-15 mins
Then yoga ( half an hour ) -- kapal bharti, anulom bilom, bhramri

Return home by 7:30-8

Tulsi leaves and Honey, lemon, warm water in empty stomach

Breakfast : Peanut butter bread / sattu (gram flour) / cornflakes

Juice in between

Lunch : very small portion of rice, green veggies, curd, lentils

Green tea, cornflakes 

Cycling sometimes 

Dinner : oats / 2 roti and veggies

My family they don't like spices( we are vegetarian) , so you might get what veggies i have been on. 

There was hardly any cheat day ( 5-10 days max i guess ).

Results --
 Current weight(as in July) -- 70 kgs ( A f***ing zero change ). Yes not even 500 gm. Is this for real? Yes it is. Even i was shocked and heartbroken when the weight machine read this value. ( Was expecting atleast some change )
Conclusion --

I tried pushing myself harder each day, while deep down i didn't know all these are actually doing no good. Tried refraining myself from all bad habits. 

Bad takes -- 

Hypothyroidism is sick. Researched a lot on how to overcome. Did everything possible. I feel weak now. 

Somethings are just not meant to be. Had i ate good food my brain would have worked better, rather counting calories each time while eating, I would have been more happy. 

Comparing with others is the worst of all. Not every body are meant to come in shape no matter whatever u do. 

Yes I am heartbroken, depressed. Everyone shows success after trained workout. Probably I am the only one who is unable to share anything of that sort. 


Good takes ---

Probably I was doing everything wrong. Taking a coach (CultFit, Healthifyme) would have been a better option.

I hit the field daily and I never regret for it since atlease I get to play football.

The yoga was a good experience(sitting beside a river bank), should have continued.

PS: I have decided. I wont stop exercising. But wont let this shitty disease take my life. Would stop the hardcore dieting, want to grab some good food and live happy. And consult a good fitness/diet coach(if possible).
