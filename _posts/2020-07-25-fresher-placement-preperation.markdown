Almost everyone in their junior year has one bugging question from their seniors - “How to prepare for placements?” As simple as this question may sound, the answer to it is not simple. At first glance it sounds like a simple question, but one appreciates its complexity and intricacies only when they deep dive into it. What resources to use? Which coding platform to use for preparation? What areas to focus on ? Is knowledge of XYZ skill necessary and many more. Here I will try to address most of the queries that everyone has in their junior year.

<br/>

1. Does CGPA matter?<br/>
	Yes, <b>a single piece of paper does decide your future.</b> Maintain a decent CGPA as most of the companies have a minimum CGPA criteria, which they may or maynot reveal. Also a good CGPA gives a good first impression of the candidate. Every company has different CGPA criteria, between 7.5 to 8.5 on a scale of 10. 


2. What if I don’t qualify the CGPA criteria?<br/>
	Try applying despite that as the final CGPA threshold depends on the applications received. Say if CGPA cut-off is set at 8 but less than 5% applicants satisfy that criteria, the hiring company might think of relaxing it a bit. If you are filtered out after applying, prepare for the next company.


3. Getting over the fear of the written round<br/>
	The written round is a test of your aptitude skills required for the role you are being hired for. Hence preparation and content for these tests may vary. Based on my experience, I have appeared for the following three kinds of roles-
	<ol>
		<li><b>SDE Role:</b> Most of the product based companies hire for this role.The standard pattern is 3 questions in 75  to 90 minutes. Most commonly used platforms are Hackerrank, Codechef(DirectI), HackerEarth, Aspiring Minds, Mettl(Amazon, Microsoft). Get well versed with these platforms as what they provide and what not. Also few companies may monitor the test from their end and so tab switching is not allowed, even if you want to refer to some code written by you. So you must be well versed with solving a problem without any external help like Google, even for standard algorithms.<br/>
			The time limit is enough for you to solve all three problems. Each problem is of varying difficulty. Generally it will be Medium, Medium, Hard (anyways you can solve the easy problems so I would recommend to practice for MMH format). The main goal should be to read all the problems at a glance and start with the easiest one. Then if the problem is fully (all test cases passed) completed then move on to the next. But if you are stuck in partial submission try not to spend excess time. Since it is also that some hiring are done with "number of test cases passed instead of solving all problem correctly"
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Analyst Role:</b> Banks such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs hire for such roles. They expect you to have good programming as well as good fundamental knowledge. You will have 1-2 coding questions and also mcqs or guess the output type of questions from core cs domains like os, dbms, networks, oops, program debugging(C/C++/JAVA). Each of these domains have a separate section and each section has a separate time limit. Basically they want you to have a decent grasp on all aspects of computer science. The coding question is doable within the given time limit. 
		</li>
		<li><b>Consultant Role:</b> Companies like ZS Associates, PwC, Deloitte hire for this profile. They expect you to have strong fundamentals and aptitude. Mostly there won’t be any programming question or one that is very easy. Questions will be aptitude based and also from cs fundamentals.</li>
	</ol>
	<b>Preparation:</b> [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) and [interviewbit](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/) are the best resources for preparation if you are applying for an SDE role <b>They have an abundance of questions with good test cases and tutorials. </b>Important suggestions: 
	<ul>
		<li>Instead of solving all questions, try to solve all varieties of questions.</li> 
		<li>Prefer using a simple IDE with no code-completion feature. Also try to get acquainted with the above mentioned online platforms. <a href="https://ideone.com/">IDEOne</a> is one such compiler</li>
		<li>Also try to participate in a few <a href="https://codeforces.com/">Codeforces</a>(Div 2), <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK105">Codechef cook-off</a> and <a href="https://www.codechef.com/LTIME86?itm_campaign=contest_listing">lunchtime</a> contests. This will help you develop the instinct of solving problems in a limited time.</li> 
	</ul>

4. Getting on in an One-On-One with the interviewer (Interview Round)<br/>
	Every company wants to test a candidate thoroughly before hiring and hence they conduct 2-3 technical interview rounds for that. Each of these rounds have varying difficulty and purpose to test various skills of the candidate. These include - 
	<ul>
		<li>Approach to solve a problem</li>
		<li>Application skills, i.e, how a candidate applies available knowledge to solve complex problems.</li>
		<li>System Design </li>
		<li>CS Fundamentals</li>
	</ul>
	Every question is aimed at evaluating the candidate at one or more of these parameters.
Also all these rounds are pen and paper rounds, ie, you will not have access to any IDE. Even if you are having your interviews remotely, you will be provided with a google doc page to write your code on. 

<b>Group Discussion:</b> This is rare and although only few companies conduct this round, one must be prepared for this. 
While at job, there will often be situations that involve in-depth discussion within or outside your team. A good engineer is expected to have good listening as well as speaking skills. This round will test exactly that.
You will be given the GD topic 5min in advance. Every person will be given a limited time to put forth their views on the topic and after that it will become open to all as speakers question each other's views. During the GD, stay calm and listen carefully to what other speakers have to say.

<b>Problem solving round: </b> In this round the interviewer will ask you coding questions and you are expected to come up with a fully functional code which will be tested against sample test cases. You will have anywhere between 45-60 min. During the interview -
<ul>
	<li>Understand the question before jumping into the solution, clarify with the interviewer that you have understood the question correctly by using a test input and test output. (Ask if you have confusion with any edge cases)
	</li>
	<li>Keep communicating your approach with the interviewer. This will help the interviewer understand your thought process and guide you to the solution. Don’t shy away from discussions, especially if you have encountered some edge cases.
	</li>
	<li>Don’t get stuck for too long on a single question. If you feel you’re stuck, have a discussion with the interviewer. Ask them what they have to say about your approach and tell them why and where you are stuck. This gives them an idea of what all you have done till now.
	</li>
	<li>Writing code should be the last thing you should be doing after you have discussed your solution with the interviewer including. Try to write a clean, working code in the first attempt with all the edge cases covered. Dry run your code using the test cases you were given(or you asked for) during the interview before submitting your code. 
	</li>
</ul><br/>
<b> Preparation Tips:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Practice writing a fully functional code on paper.</li>
	<li>Practice communication and discuss solutions with your peers in the language you will be using in the interview(mostly English). This will help you communicate your approach with the interviewer. A large number of candidates are unable to communicate their ideas clearly to the interviewer, hence rejected.</li>
	<li>The difficulty level of questions will depend upon the role you are being hired for. SDE >> Analyst >> Consultant</li>
	<li>Practice mock interviews on <a href="https://www.interviewbit.com/mock-interview/">interviewbit</a>, <a href="https://www.pramp.com/">pramp</a>.</li>
</ul> 	

<b>System Design:</b>
<ul>
	<li><b>Low Level Design:</b> Most companies ask this. The interviewer will ask you to design an application like a payment app, or a ticket booking app, etc. You will have to come up with a broad level class design like what classes will be used, member variables and functions of each class and how these classes will interact with each other. Your design should be modular and scalable to handle changes in application requirement. There is no right or wrong answer for such questions. So make sure to discuss your approach thoroughly with your interviewer. <a href="https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-object-oriented-design-interview/RMlM3NgjAyR">Educative.io</a> is a good resource. (free with Github Student Pack)
	</li>
	<li><b>High Level Design:</b> Few companies ask this. Questions are asked on scalability of a large system and all. Refer to <a href="https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview/m2ygV4E81AR">this</a> link. </li>
</ul>

<b>Preparation Tips</b>
<ul>
	<li>Practice writing a fully functional object oriented code on paper.</li>
	<li>Get comfortable with at least one Object Oriented programming language. Also learn about the nuances of that language. Eg: C++ exhibits diamond problem in inheritance which JAVA does not. So you should know how to mitigate such situations if your choice of language is C++.</li>

</ul>

<b>CS Fundamentals:</b>
It needs no explanation as to why you must have strong fundamental concepts. Time and again you will encounter situations where your fundamental understanding will be tested while on job like optimizing memory usage, process synchronization, etc. You must have strong fundamental concepts. Questions will be asked from OS, DBMS, OOPS and Computer Networks. Direct as well as application based questions may be asked. 

<ul>
	<li><b>OS: </b>Refer to this <a href="https://qr.ae/pNsYfn">this</a></li>
	<li><b>DBMS:</b>You must be familiar with database basic concepts like keys, normalization, ACID properties, indexing, transaction management. You can refer <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/">here</a> for preparing. </li>
	<li><b>OOPS:</b>Follow this <a href="https://www.edureka.co/blog/interview-questions/oops-interview-questions">link</a> for pointers to what topics to prepare. </li>
	<li><b>Computer Networks:</b>You must be familiar with OSI stack. Follow <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/commonly-asked-computer-networks-interview-questions-set-1/">this</a> link for some common questions.</li>
</ul>

5. I’m good in tech interviews but HR interviews freak me out. What to do?<br/>
Candidates often complain about being rejected in HR rounds despite having a strong technical knowledge. This is because they don’t treat HR interviews as seriously as the technical interviews. Hiring companies want to ensure that you are a good fit for their organization, technically as well as behaviorally, and the HR round does exactly that. The interviewer will try to evaluate-
<ul>
	<li>Your personality, strengths and weaknesses alike.</li>
	<li>Your ability to gel with new people.</li>
	<li>Your capacity to deal with challenging circumstances.</li>
</ul>

So, the questions asked here are pretty straightforward like-
<ul>
	<li>What are your strengths and weaknesses?</li>
	<li>What projects did you do and what was your contribution?</li>
	<li>Most difficult situation you encountered while working on a project and how you handled it?</li>
</ul>
…and many more.It is best to prepare these questions well in advance and not a day before the interview as most of the HR rounds have similar questions. Prepare your CV and projects well(follow [this]({{site.url}}/jekyll/update/2020/07/23/my-dream-resume.html) to prepare a good CV),i.e, you should be able to answer every question asked related to your CV or your project. Talk about your contribution in the project and the challenges you faced while working on it. 

<b>Preparation Tips</b>
<ul>
	<li>Prepare your CV well.</li>
	<li>Practice a few puzzles. HRs tend to ask puzzle questions to judge how you react to unknown random situations. Again, try thinking logically while solving it. <a href="https://www.interviewbit.com/puzzles/">Interviewbit</a> has some good puzzles.</li>
	<li>Be confident and don’t be nervous. HRs don’t like nervous candidates. </li>
</ul>


<b>Important points</b>
<ul>
	<li>Always read the job description thoroughly to understand what is expected of you. </li>
	<li>The hiring process will depend on the job profile you are being hired for. </li>
		<li>So try to clarify all your doubts and queries. An SDE role at Amazon may have separate responsibilities from an analyst at GoldmanSachs.</li>
	<li>Never be late and be at the reporting place earlier than asked. This helps you calm down your nerves and perform better during your interview.</li>
	<li>Dress well and be confident. At the end of the day it’s one of the many interviews that you will be appearing for throughout your career.</li>
	<li>Enjoy the interview, not everyone gets a chance like you to give the interview for a big MNC. So take it as a life experince and enjoy.</li>
</ul>
